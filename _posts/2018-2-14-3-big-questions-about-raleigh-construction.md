<h2>1. What types of construction projects have been done in Raleigh?</h2>

Between 2000 and 2018, **about 69% of planned Raleigh construction projects were residential**. Of these, the most common projects involved the construction of new buildings, while the most common non-residential projects were repairs and alterations to existing buildings



<h2>2. How much does the average construction project cost?</h2>

The average construction project in Raleigh had an estimated cost of just over $192,000, but that number requires some explanation. A few unusually expensive projects, such as additions to REX Hospital, brought up the average substantially.

In fact, **75% of projects were estimated to cost under $135,000**, and the median project ran at just $53,616. These numbers give you a better sense of how much the typical project costs than you would get by looking at the statistical mean.
