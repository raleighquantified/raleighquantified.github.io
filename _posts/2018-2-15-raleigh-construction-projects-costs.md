title:  "Estimated Costs of Raleigh Construction Projects by Year (Raleigh Open Data Project)"
---

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/raleigh_construction_projects.png)

A few outliers (such as a $130 million dollar REX Hospital expansion) forced me to compress the visualization significantly, even though the overwhelming majority of projects were estimated to cost less than $25 million. Future visualizations of this dataset will probably involve pointing out the outliers and then removing them. Let me know if you have any ideas.

*There's probably a lot more I could do with this data. Are there any questions you would like me to answer in a future post? Does anything here make you feel curious?
